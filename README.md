# strain-analysis-based-on-eye-blinking-

Project description:
OurÂ  project strain analysis using eye blinking aims to develop an Artificial based strain analysis system using eye blinking patterns. By analysing the frequency and duration of eye blinks, using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine the blink detection as it is a scalar quantity obtained by detecting a face from an image, finding the Euclidean distance of the corresponding eye coordinates. 2D landmarks across the face are assigned at different locations, the system can detect and quantify the level of strain experienced by individuals using AI algorithms.

Tools used:
Python
OpenCv 
Face Detection 
Flask
